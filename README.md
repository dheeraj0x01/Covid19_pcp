# COVID-19 Data Analysis & Trend Forecasting

📊 Analyzing and forecasting COVID-19 case trends using real-world data with Python.

## 🔷 Project Overview
This project performs an exploratory data analysis (EDA) and builds predictive models to understand and forecast COVID-19 trends over time. By cleaning and visualizing the data, it highlights patterns in case growth, identifies peak periods, and predicts future cases using statistical and machine learning techniques.

✅ Key Objectives:
- Clean and preprocess COVID-19 daily case data
- Analyze trends in confirmed, recovered, and death cases
- Visualize regional and global COVID-19 trends
- Build time series forecasting models (e.g., ARIMA/Regression)

## 🔷 Tools & Technologies
- 📌 **Python**
- 📌 **Pandas, NumPy**
- 📌 **Matplotlib, Seaborn**
- 📌 **scikit-learn**
- 📌 Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab

## 📊 Results
- Identified regions with high case growth rates
- Predicted trends in daily and cumulative case counts
- Created insightful, easy-to-read visualizations
